## Hello there :wave:

Thank you for your interest in my code.

This is a piece of backend logic using Nodejs. In this project, I used both Node native and non-native npm packages:

- [inquirer] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
- [qr-image] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/qr-image)
- [fs] (https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)

## What does it do?

It prompt you to input a URL in the console. It uses the input to generate a scannable QR code image.
It also logs in txt file the url input submitted by the user. I will sometimes in future create a frontend for this.
